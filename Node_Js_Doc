Node Js(Ryan Dahl).

Server Side Applicaton development.

JavaScript use to run on Browser only

Node js is runtime for JavaScript.
	It can compile and execute JavaScript scripts.
	It does this using the same V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript in the Chrome browser.
	
	
Browser will have JavaScript engine
	V8 --> Chrome
	Chakra --> IE
	JS Core --> Safari
	
	
V8 embeded in C++ environment resulted in Node.

Build Backend web application.


Features of Node

	Relies on asynchronous APIs.

	Event-driven.
	
	Coding in JavaScript.
	
	Built with scalability(Vertical, Horizontal) in mind.
	
	No multi-threading
	
	Comes with Node Package Manager(npm) and npmjs.com
	
Event loop:
	Used to run asynchronous code.
	
	Node Js Single Threaded application.
	
	Node is not for CPU intense operation.
	
	
	global and process are two objects provided in Node.
	
	
	REPL ==> Read, Evaluate
	
	
	.save
	
	.load
	
	.help
	
	.exit
	
let and var

Scopes in JavaScript
	Global
	Function
	
let
	Non pollutig global object
	block scope
	
	
	{
		let userEmail="shridhar.kulkarni@socgen";		
	}
	console.log(userEmail); //this will throw error as userEmail is defined within block.
	
	
	callback function:
	
	function passed as parameter to anothe function.
	
	setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(name +' ' + this.greeting);
        },0);
		
		
	inner function:
	
	var obj={
    greeting:'Good Morning!!',

    greet:function(name){
        //console.log(name +' ' + this.greeting);
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(name +' ' + this.greeting);
        },0);
    }
}

funtion borrowing:

	funtionality defined in one object using in other object
	
	
Observer pattern

	event emitter in Node JS:
		Listening to event
		Create/Generate event.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		Node server.
		
			nodemon ==> Package to keep track of the changes and restart the code. It should be installed globally.
				npm i nodemon -global
			
			lodash ==> For build in methods. One of the popular library available.
			
			
			
			
			Express: Server SIDE RESTful API development.
			
			
			
			npm i express
			
			
			npm i morgan // to have logging thrird party middleware
			
		npm i pug // templating engine	
		
		
		DOT NET WEB API. Passing URL Encoded Parameters in POST method
